# What is this?
A Reworked Version of Internet Billing Manager App by surdaysoft.

# What's on this reworked version?
Just some things that bring the main function works again, since the original one is built on older version of PHP and has lost update by his original author, i've do some things on this :

-Fixed the database connection, the original one still using mysql function that already deprecated on PHP 7.

-Some adjustment on the main function.

-And another things.

Yes this still don't have a well-structured design, but atleast the main function still worked. Then you can do anything you want.

# Usage :

-Import netbill-db.sql.

-Edit database connection in inc/config.php.
